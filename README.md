C is the divine language for programmers and essential to build solid coding foundation so I started my tech journey with it.

Here I have shared my solutions mainly for pointers,structure,dma and miscellenous qs which cover C in depth.

Learning C was a difficult process but as they say nothing worthwhile comes easy in life.
